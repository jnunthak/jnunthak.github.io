      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        Hi, I'm <strong>Jeyadave Nuntha Kumar</strong>, a passionate Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) engineer and researcher with a deep interest in aerodynamics, turbulence modeling, and simulation techniques. I thrive at the intersection of technical rigor and creative problem-solving, focusing on impactful projects that push the boundaries of aerospace technology.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm currently completing my undergraduate studies in Aerospace Engineering at the University of Maryland - College Park, with minors in Mathematics and Global Engineering Leadership. My academic journey is driven by a commitment to excellence, reflected in my consistent academic achievements and involvement in cutting-edge research.
      </p>
      <h2>What Drives Me</h2>
      <p>
        My professional interests are rooted in making significant contributions to the aerospace industry, particularly through the lens of CFD. Beyond engineering, I am passionate about fostering inclusivity in STEM, mentoring aspiring engineers, and bridging the gap between academia and real-world applications.
      </p>
      <h2>Outside of Work</h2>
      <p>
        Outside of my technical pursuits, I enjoy building remote-controlled aircraft, exploring new ideas in leadership development, and advocating for inclusive practices in engineering education. My multicultural background, spanning the USA and Singapore, has given me a global perspective and an appreciation for diverse ideas and cultures.
